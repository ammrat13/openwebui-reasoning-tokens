# Additional Notes

After installing and enabling, 3 models will be added which will have the _Thinking..._ feature.
These models will be prefixed with `reasoning/`.

You will probably have an issue with the generated titles.
You can go to Admin Panel -> Settings -> Interface, then change the **Task Model** to something else instead of "Current Model".
